            <h3>Respect other people</h3>
            <p>You are not the only person in the queue.</p>
            <p>It is equally annoying to wait.</p>
            <p>Be polite. You don’t like to be disturbed by other people waiting in line next to you, so why bother others? Don't talk too loud while waiting in line.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="cardTwo" class="card dCard">
            <h3>Mind the personal space</h3>
            <p>Invading other people's space won't make the queue faster.</p>
            <p>Be mindful and leave a comfortable amount of gap of 8-16 inches between you and them.</p>
            <p>Especially during special period such as an epidemic, be mindful of safe distancing.</p>
            <p>Stand as close unto others as you would have like them to stand unto you.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="cardThree" class="newCard dCard">
            <h3>Do not skip the line</h3>
            <p>Line jumping, queue jumping or butting can almost be called a social taboo.</p>
            <p>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
            <p>Average queue-standers are 54% likely to object to someone butting in.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="cardFour" class="card dCard">
            <h3>Keep your anger low</h3>
            <p>Taking out your frustration on other people is not the way to go about it.</p>
            <p>Ask yourself this: would you have liked to get shouted at?</p>
            <p>Be patient about it. Inform the person responsible for queuing about your issue, and see if they can do something about it.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="cardFive" class="card dCard">
            <h3>Offer your place in line to someone who needs it more</h3>
            <p>If you're standing in a grocery line and the person behind you seems to need it more, offer to trade places.</p>
            <p>Older people, pregnant women, women with young children and disabled people are not fit enough to queue for too long.</p>
            <p>This simple act of kindness will not cost alot, so offer your place to someone else who needs it more.</p>
